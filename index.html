      <!-- maybe I can make the interests change on a page reload? I have so many interests, lol -->
        <p>Currently completing a Bachelor of Computer Science at The University of Newcastle,<br>
            and have successfully completed a Cert IV in Graphic Design<br>
            at Shillington College, Sydney. I'm interning at Consultation Manager as a full-stack<br>
            software developer.<br>
            When I'm not studying or working, you can find me scrolling through<br>
            fashion archives, playing video games, or cooking.

            I have experience in full-stack development, and UI/UX design. Other areas of interest include computer graphics programming, human-computer interaction, and 3D modelling.
