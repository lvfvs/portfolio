<p>Living in Australia, I am a recent B CS graduate from The University of Newcastle. 
    I've been lucky enough to have completed two internships in the web development field 
    during my final year of study. I also completed a Cert IV in Graphic Design throughout 2015. <br />
    I love what I do. <br />
    I have experience in frontend development, and UI/UX design. Other areas of interest include 
    computer graphics, human-computer interaction, game design, and 3D modelling.<br />
