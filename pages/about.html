    <p class="about">
      Living in Australia, I am a recent B CS graduate from The University of
      Newcastle. I've been lucky enough to have completed two internships in the
      web development field during my final year of study. I also completed a
      Cert IV in Graphic Design throughout 2015. <br />
      I love what I do. <br />
      I have experience in frontend development, and UI/UX design. Other areas
      of interest include computer graphics, human-computer interaction, game
      design, and 3D modelling.<br />
